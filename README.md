# Olist-ecommerce-sales
This Brazilian e-commerce business is called Olist. They want an examination of the orders that their consumers have placed.
The e-commerce store is the subject of three datasets in Olist: orders.xlsx, order_payment.xlsx, and customers.xlsx.
They are concerned that too many clients are using credit, so they have asked for the following.
Combine the three datasets, then perform some minor cleanup. 
1. They want to examine the range of payment amounts broken down by payment method, such as debit, credit, etc. 
2. They want to know whether credit card payments result in greater payment values.
3. They want to view the amount paid for each month of the year by the method of payment. 
4. They also want to view the total amount paid each month.
